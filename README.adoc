# GeoIP batch

Extract the ISO country code based on the IP. You need to install first the free
http://www.ip2nation.com/[ip2nation Mysql database]. The `local` profile is enabled
by default so you can use that to store the credentials of your local installation,
something like

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-db
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=secret
```

See `GeoIpProperties` for more configuration options
